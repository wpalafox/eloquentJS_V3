/*
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz"
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it,
youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)

//My solution 

for(i=1;i<=100;i++){
	
	if(i%5==0 && i%3==0){
		console.log("FizzBuzz");
	}

	else if(i%3 == 0){
		console.log("Fizz");
	}

	else if(i%5==0){
		console.log("Buzz");
	} 
	
	else{
		console.log(i);
	}

}


//Author Solution 

for (var n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {
  var output = "";
  if (n % 3 == 0)
    output += "Fizz";
  if (n % 5 == 0)
    output += "Buzz";
  console.log(output || n);

}
